Build army lists for races of the 40k universe. 

Build using Flask, Python and node package manager. 

## To run at home:
1. Install npm (node package manager) 
2. Ensure Python3 is installed on your machine
3. Clone the git repository
5. Use npm to install the projects requisite packages 
  - from a command line (where the repository has been cloned) type 'npm install'
6. Run the start up script 
  - from the command line run 'npm start'



## Ideas for later:
 - compare army list stats
 - Link to shops where models can be purchased
