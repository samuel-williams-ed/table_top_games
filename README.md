# table_top_games
Create and edit faction lists for games set in the 40k universe. 

A full-stack, web-based app designed using RESTful API principles. Built using Flask, Python and node package manager. 

## To run at home:
1. Install npm (node package manager) 
2. Ensure Python3 is installed on your machine
3. Clone the git repository
5. Use npm to install the projects packages 
  - Todo: from a command line (where the repository has been cloned) type 'npm install'
6. Run the start up script 
  - Todo: from the command line run 'npm start'



## Ideas for later:
 - Generate list stats. (Eg., Points per model, average output, average toughness)
 - Link to sites with further documentation and lore on each faction / model.
